> Home office segment makes the least sales

## Conclusion :
* We can conclude that our sales are higher as compared to our profit.
* Tables, Bookcases and Supplies are responsible for maximum losses( in negative)
 
### Weak Areas :
* Though Copiers are the least sold products it makes most of the profit so, we must look for ways to improve the sales of the Copiers.
* Tables should either be removed from the market or major changes should be made to tables in order to not incur losses in future.
* We should try to improve our sales in North Dakota, South Dakota , West Virginia and Columbia using new techniques.
* Our sales at Illinois, Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania are making losses so we must concentrate on the loss making issues in this region.
* So , in order to improve our sales and profit we must pay special attention to our losses and strengthen our weak areas as mentioned above.
